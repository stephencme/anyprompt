# anyprompt

**AnyPrompt** helps AI application developers create, manage, and test LLM prompts. The monorepo contains three packages:

- **@anyprompt/core**: a tiny library for configuring and rendering prompt templates.
- **@anyprompt/sdk**: an SDK for fetching and rendering prompt templates from an AnyPrompt API.
- **@anyprompt/web**: the AnyPrompt web app and API.

This project is designed to be easily self-hosted via Vercel and Supabase.
